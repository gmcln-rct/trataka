is pressed, and from that an audio visualization (in the form of a flame) is created. The user can click the button again to stop the flame.

Each individual soundscape -- and the flame audio-visualization it creates -- is unique and ephemeral.

### Inspirations
ephemeralLight is based on the tantric meditation method of Trāṭaka ("look" or "gaze") which involves staring at a single point, such as a small object or candle light, to gain focus and achieve mindfulness. Trāṭaka is often used for yogic purification.
